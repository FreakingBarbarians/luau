# Generalized iteration

## Summary

Introduce support for iterating over tables without using `pairs`/`ipairs` as well as a generic customization point for iteration via `__iter` metamethod.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Design

This is the bulk of the proposal. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the language to understand, and include examples of how the feature is used.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?
